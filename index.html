            <b> How it Works: </b> Game theory is a field of a study that determines what the best move for a particular player
            in a game is at a given instant. This field has been deeply developed for economics but has broad applications elsewhere.
            Early in the development of Game Theory a prominent mathemetician, von Neumann, created an algorithm which would consider
            a game where one player is attempting to maximize the output while the other is attempting to minimize the output.
            His algorithm would determine the best move for a given player to ensure that the score is either the highest (or lowest),
            assuming their opponent would make the best decision for what they wanted to accomplish. His algorithm is commonly known as 
            the minmax (or minimax) algorithm. Chess is such a game where we can apply von Neumann's algorithm. We can assign each piece
            a value and determine that black pieces are a negative value while white pieces are a positive, with more weight given
            to more valuable pieces (e.g. queen is 9 while pawn is 1). Then we sum all the pieces on the board, yielding an 
            initial game score of 0 (all black and white pieces cancel out). In this instance, black is attempting to minimize the score
            while white is attempting to maximize the score. We can then run through von Neumann's minimax algorithm for every possible
            move that a player could make and then every move the opponent could make given the initial move and so on for some given
            search depth. For example, if we gave a depth of 5, then the algorithm would search 5 moves ahead and determine what initial
            move would result in the highest score (assuming their opponent plays the best move that they could make). This algorithm 
            seemingly falls a part when the opponent is making moves that are not necessarily good for them. For example, if we set white
            to have a search depth of 4 while black has a search depth of 1, then black will take whatever piece he could at a given
            instant (even if that piece they used could easily be taken after). White's attempts to strategize are foiled by the seemingly
            foolish moves of black.
